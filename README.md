eqMac2 is a Free System-Wide Equalizer for the Mac.

### How it started
If you are interested to know how eqMac was created, you can read the [Story](https://github.com/romankisil/eqMac2/blob/master/STORY.md)

### How it works
I basically took Apple's [CAPlayThrough example](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/CAPlayThrough/Introduction/Intro.html) and modified the AUGraph to have an EQ node. Combined it with [SoundFlower Audio Driver](https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower) and it just worked.
