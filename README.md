## How it works

I basically took Apple's [CAPlayThrough example](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/CAPlayThrough/Introduction/Intro.html) and modified the AUGraph to have an EQ node. Combined it with [SoundFlower Audio Driver](https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower) and it just worked.
