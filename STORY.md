### The story so far:
#### Me:
Hey, my name is Roman and I'm mainly a Full Stack TypeScript developer, Objective-C is just a hobby.

#### Idea:
In 2015 I finished University (Computer Hardware and Software Engineering course) and was pretty poor. Back then I liked to listen to Music 24/7, but I always had cheap headphones and the experice wasn't the best. I knew I can make my headphones better with a good Audio Equalizer. Made some research and found Boom2, like all of us did. But when I looked at the price I felt disgusted. Being that I'm a fresh Software Developer graduate I was very keen to apply myself somewhere. I decided that I will build my own Equalizer.
#### eqMac1 Summer 2015:
Back then Objective-C was always my language of choice. 
I've spent around a month building the first version of eqMac. Had to do loads of reading but mostly it was pretty simple. Due to stupidity I coded the entire UI rather than using the Interface Builder. Honestly, the hardest part was doing the Website where people could download the app.
I released eqMac v1 for Free in August of 2015 and it started to slowly gather attention. In the first year I got around 50k downloads, just from the website. 
That year I took time off working on eqMac as I had to kick start my career. 
#### eqMac2 Sept. 2016:
In Septermber of 2016 I felt more stable with personal life and decided to do a Second release of eqMac2. This time I thought I would do a Freemium model with a 'free' basic app and some paid 'premium' functionality (like support for Bluetooth etc.) I followed this goal for about 9 months, spent around 1000 hours making eqMac2 more stable and prettier than its predecessor. I was 90% of the way there, before I realised that I don't want to turn eqMac into a business and a full-time job (just wasn't enjoying native development that much anymore). I decided to make eqMac an Open-Source project with hopes that we as a community can achieve much more than me, working on it alone. As of June 2017 eqMac has 125k Downloads.
